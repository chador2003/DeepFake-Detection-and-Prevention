🧠 DeepFake Detection and Prevention
A Comprehensive AI-Powered Approach to Identify Manipulated Images

Welcome to the DeepFake Detection and Prevention project!
This project leverages the power of AI and deep learning to detect manipulated images (deepfakes). With the rise of misinformation, it's critical to have tools that help verify the authenticity of digital content.

🔍 Core Focus:

Identify deepfake images with a trained neural network

Explain the prediction output (real or fake)

Deliver a user-friendly interface using Streamlit

This repository is ideal for researchers, developers, and security enthusiasts interested in combating digital deception.

🚀 Usage Guide
Follow the steps below to run the application on your machine:
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Ramya-Mahi/DeepFake-Detection-and-Prevention-A-Comprehensive-approach-using-AI.git
2. Navigate to the project directory
